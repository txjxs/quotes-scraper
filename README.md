# 📚 Stoic Quotes Scraper

This Python web scraper collects **Stoic quotes** from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/stoicism). It extracts the following details for each quote:

- 📝 **Quote Text**  
- ✍️ **Author Name**  
- 📖 **Book Title** (if available)  
- 🏷️ **Associated Tags**  

The scraper navigates through all available pages on the site and saves the collected data into a CSV file (`stoic_quotes_full.csv`). It includes a delay between page requests to avoid server overload and uses appropriate headers for responsible scraping.
